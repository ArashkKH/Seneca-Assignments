1. declare biteCount and set it to 0

2. take a bite  ( add 1 to biteCount )

3. is the apple finished? (IS biteCount greater or equal to 8)
    NO: has horsey messaged you?
        NO: eat again (repeat from step 2)
        YES: Yell: "Time to Gallop"
    // Yell: "Time to Gallop"
Yell: "Im full!!"
// wrong : what if they dont message
// wrong : what if they text when you're done eating?
// Context : it would be better to say im full first then time to go!
